      <h1>Hello tech enthusiasts!</h1>
      <p>
        I am an experienced software engineer, on a quest to learn about the crypto space. 
        I created this blog site to track my progress as I teach myself how to develop on the Solana blockchain. 
        Join me and follow along as I work through the <a href="https://www.soldev.app/course">Solana development course</a>.
